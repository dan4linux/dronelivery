*******************************************************

Building:

From the project root, run "mvn packge" which will use maven to build the jar file.  
It will be placed in the ./target directory and will contain all necessary dependencies.
If the build fails on the "Sample vs Generated Output" test, this is likely due to unix vs dos format of the test.output file in src/test/resources.

Running:

To run the jar you can use the following:

java -jar target\dronlivery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <path/to/input/file>

If you run the jar without the file path you will see the usage message.

Example usage output:

C:\Users\dan4l\eclipse-workspace\dronlivery>java -jar target\dronlivery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Usage: class net.swansonstuff.dronlivery.Dronlivery </path/to/input/file>

Settable Properties:
  "date.format=HH:mm:ss"
  "delivery.field.delimiter= "
  "start.hour=6"
  "drones=1"
  "handling.time.millis=1000"

================================================================

A number of assumptions were made in this code:
* A number of items should be configurable as shown in the usage page
* The path taken by the drone is "as the crow flies" and not following the grid path
* "Handling time" should be taken into account for calculating delivery time in addition to travel time
* Multiple algorithms should be supported to find the "best" route which may vary by data set
* Multiple drones may be supported in the future so the code is built to support that case with minimal changes if any
